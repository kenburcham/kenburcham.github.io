Hello Tinkerer
==============

I'm inspired to start blogging again, if for no other reason that to have
a place to post ongoing work and ideas. Generally, I'm a bit too utilitarian to 
take the time to write. Or maybe too driven or results-oriented. But I've gotten 
so much out of the blogs of so many others, I thought it is about time to slow 
down a bit and write about the solutions I'm finding to problems as I find them.

There are a few posts scattered around that might be useful:

* `How to Add AI to your WordPress Website <https://medium.com/@kenburcham/how-to-add-ai-to-your-wordpress-site-5470e1c833d5/>`_ - An article promoting my WordPress plugin I created for Algorithmia.
* `How to Setup a Remote Water Temperature Datalogger to Send Data via the NOAA GOES Satellite`<https://medium.com/@kenburcham/how-to-setup-a-remote-water-temperature-datalogger-to-send-data-via-the-noaa-goes-satellite-7f846aa393be>`_ - Explanation of the long, complex process of getting our remote datalogger working.

I'll keep working on this. (promises, promises. :)
