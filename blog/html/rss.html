            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Hello Tinkerer</h1>
<p>I’m inspired to start blogging again, if for no other reason that to have a place to post ongoing work and ideas. Generally, I’m a bit too utilitarian to take the time to write. Or maybe too driven or results-oriented or overwhelmed by saying “YES!” to too many things. But I’ve gotten so much out of the blogs of so many others, I thought it is about time to slow down a bit and write. Write about solutions, problems, interesting ideas; anything is fair game here.</p>
<p>There are a few existing posts scattered around in other places that might be useful:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/@kenburcham/how-to-add-ai-to-your-wordpress-site-5470e1c833d5/">How to Add AI to your WordPress Website</a> - An article promoting my WordPress plugin I created for Algorithmia.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/@kenburcham/how-to-setup-a-remote-water-temperature-datalogger-to-send-data-via-the-noaa-goes-satellite-7f846aa393be">How to Setup a Remote Water Temperature Datalogger to Send Data via the NOAA GOES Satellite</a> - Explanation of the long, complex process of getting our remote datalogger working.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why <a class="reference external" href="http://tinkerer.me">Tinkerer</a>? It is simple, attractive enough in its default form, open source, Python, generates static pages, and uses reStructuredText which I’ve wanted to try out for awhile.</p>
<p>I’ll keep working on this. (promises, promises. :)</p>
